            <p>The well-patronized, user-friendly site has opened up a wealth of writing opportunities around the world for me, and as a Kiwi based Down Under that's something I certainly appreciate. I also appreciate the number of potentially suitable jobs that show up like clockwork each week, and also the excellent customer service I've experienced.

            <p>As a freelance writer, I've been an avid fan of Best Writing (formerly Content Writer Jobs) for several months now. It's clear, concise, and brings together the very best writing jobs around the world. The newsletter is fantastic and lists so many work opportunities that I would never be able to find on my own. And the blog is also loaded with incredible writing tips and best practices.

            <p>Before I found Best Writing, I manually visited job boards and spent too much time wading through an ocean of bad gigs. Now I get an email with a curated list of great gigs that are easy to apply to. Best Writing has made gig-hunting faster, easier, and more promising. I highly recommend this service to other freelance writers!
